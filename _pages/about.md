Rather be a late-bloomer than an early-finished article! I am a life-long-learning person/researcher/toastmaster, always thrive for developing not only research skills but also personal development skills. I wrote a poem about the research work of my #PhD, and could #karaoke it to win the first prize at a Science Slam :)
